    <p> <p>The session started in a very good place, with Blue having just cut a security guard in half. As the PCs ran out of the EverLife office reception, they were quickly stopped by a large black vehicle and 10 more security guards ordering them to stop and put their weapons down. They were surrounded and after much out-of-character discussion, lay any prominent weapons (Blue’s sword and Diamond’s vortex cannon) down and surrendered.</p>

<p>They were taken in the police vehicle to some station-like building somewhere else in the city, up in one of the many skyscrapers that intersect the hover-car highways. The rooms and corridors were a bleached cream-white and the building had a variety of holographic posters stating laws and rights. The PCs were taken to cells before they saw their weapons again. The cells are the same cream-white, completely sealed with a sliding door, no windows (no anything) and a dull white omnipresent light. One by one they are taken to an interview room, where their details are recorded and situations explained. Everyone is to be registered as a citizen, and a mark on their record for the part in Blue’s homicide - Blue is to be taken and deported to the ominous “third continent”. The others will be released, sans vortex cannon. Diamond was offered at some point to work for Red Dragon, when it became clear that he was a mercenary, but he declined.</p>

<p>So that happened, and the non-gulagged PCs, led by Diamond Wing, were left out on the street beneath this imposing Red Dragon Police station building. Around this time Brandon rolled up a character for Shadow, another member of Blue’s crew, and Max arrived and rolled up Iktoc, his new character.</p>

<p>The PCs returned to the underground street, looking for Rosalind and her crew (the people who found them in the ship port). After Diamond scared an old Gessuran woman in an apartment, they went down “The Sanctum”, the Theives’ Guild of the city. At the door was a Quelin bouncer - Iktoc! Inside the Sanctum was an enormous feasting hall surrounded on all sides by thin numerous thin apartments made up of 3 rooms, vertically. Diamond talked briefly to a couple of Utuns tinkering with a laser rifle (their names were Zuul and Ral, now don’t forget that Tom I know how you are with NPCs and let’s not even <em>mention</em> their voices, like come on, seriously), asking about turning his laser taser into something a bit more useful in exchange for his two type B energy cells. They agreed.</p>

<p>Rosalind was found alone in her home and invited the PCs (and Iktoc, who is reasonably well known around here) in. They explained the situation and she was sympathetic but unsure as to how she could help - though that she would if she could. Diamond left to get some knives, looking again in the weapon store by the ship port, but couldn’t find anything useful. The PCs then returned to the Comet Cruiser, where they dropped off Tak and Nova, checked in with the rest of the crew and obtained Shadow. Shadow, who conveniently had hacking tools in his equipment list, tried to hack the terminal but failed. However, after using Iktoc’s citizen ID, they managed to progress through the terminal’s requirement - it now want’s a ship license. Iktoc knows someone who might be able to get them a forged license - for a price, usually a job.</p>

<p>The PCs ran back through the ship parking building to the street, back through the weapon shop, much to the annoyance of Anna, the elderly Human shopkeeper. The fixer Iktoc spoke of - a Mr Janssen - lives in an office block on the end of a street. Shadow and Iktoc went to see him, while Diamond went looking for knives or some shit. In Janssen’s office, he said he could get them a decent fake license in about 3 days - in exchange, they would bring back another person from the gulag Blue was sent to. We ended the session as Shadow and Iktoc discussed terms with Janssen.</p>
