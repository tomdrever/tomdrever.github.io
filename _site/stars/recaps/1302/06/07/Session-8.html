    <p> <p>After a night’s stay in the large metal container aboard the freighter, the ground crew arrived at the facility. The container was transported into the facility and then came to a stop inside what appeared to be a large warehouse facility. The sound of the room’s crane hefting hundreds of similarly sized boxes around the rooms continued for a couple of hours, and then came to an end, with the lights dimmed. Shadow slipped out of the container doors and hid until a guard who monitored this area walked past, at which point he leapt out from between two boxes and wrestled with the man, eventually managing to restrain him, and allowing Diamond Wing to sprint out of the container and bring his two knives into action, cutting the man’s throat and plunging into his chest. The corpse was dragged away and hidden in the container, while Diamond Wing used Shadow’s shirt to mop up the blood.</p>

<p>At this point, the crew left the container, and noticed a security camera at the end of the room and the entry to the next, which was a large doorway, several metres wide and high. Another exit was luckily found, and while Shadow, Tak, and Iktoc used their data slab to allow Victor and Nova to hack into the door and open it from miles away, Diamond Wing noticed an autonomous truck passing slowly, and chased after it for a while before failing, then succeeding to grab on to the back and get inside. This was a fancier container, and there were several large packages inside, which contained some fancy thermal pistols, and a slug-throwing sniper rifle – lacking ammunition unfortunately. Diamond Wing grabbed as many of these as he could, then bade his time. 
During this, Nova and Victor were finally able to hack the door and allow the rest of the gang to pass through. They found a smaller corridor with wiring running along the top, which Shadow promptly slashed with his weapon… Setting off a small alarm system. Nevertheless, they were not discovered, and a wee maintenance drone eventually popped out of a small hole in the ceiling to fix the needless destruction. It was hence decided that Tak ought to climb up into the ceiling and crawl through the vent. He struggled up into the vents with the help of Shadow, and began to make his way through the system, hoping that his path didn’t lie directly over the large explosion which Diamond was planning to set off.</p>

<p>Big Bird’s vehicle had, by now, stopped moving, and so he elected to get out and look around. This was the first mistake. For some reason, the area was alarmed, and his movement set it off – a proper alarm this time, one which Shadow, Iktoc, and Tak all heard. Two light armsmen were summoned immediately, weapons drawn, and exchanged a couple of salvos with Diamond Wing, who dual wielded the thermal pistols he had stolen. Every single shot missed its mark.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Shadow and Iktoc had made their way to the end of the corridor they had been in, and found a door which opened automatically for them. Pleased with this, they decided to shoot out the security camera which was facing almost exactly at them in the room they had just entered. This was the second mistake. Iktoc aimed straight and true, and his shot was a stunner, completely obliterating the camera. However, it also managed to grab the attention of two of the five soldiers who happened to be sprinting past at the very moment he fired. They peeled off and engaged the pair, while the other three continued through the doorway at the end of the room, straight into the fire of Diamond Wing. However, in a frankly stunningly incompetent moment, he managed to place these shots straight past the trio, and decided to simply run away from the situation, which was souring by the second. 
Tak had, by this point, been in the vents for a few minutes, and you can imagine his displeasure when he noticed the same maintenance drone from earlier moving rapidly towards his rear, in what amounted to a Toolstation parody of the first Alien movie. He was able to drop out of the vents just in time to see Diamond Wing rush into the room he had fallen into – a rather dark one full of what were essentially shopping trollies. Tak crashed into one from above, and Diamond Wing threw him a spare pistol, before telling him to get back into the vent. He then retrieved the fuel bomb from his pack, which convinced Tak to follow the advice, and hid it amongst a few boxes in the centre of the relatively small room, before setting a timer for 30 seconds. He struggled up into the vent and began to make his escape with Tak a way up ahead of him.</p>

<p>The battle had gone worse for Shadow and Iktoc. Shadow had been hit first, two bolts from the soldiers’ laser rifles caught him and he went down. Iktoc was able to put down one of them with a single blast, but by that point he too had been wounded, and a second shot from the other foe sent him to the floor too. Both now lie unconscious – but not dead – on the floor there. The question is – will Tak and Diamond Wing get back in time to save the pair with Lazarus patches? Will they be caught in the fuel bomb explosion? Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z!</p>
