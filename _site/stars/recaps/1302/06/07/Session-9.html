    <p> <p>We started the session with a bang, as Tak and Diamond scurried through the maintenance vent back towards the corridor having just set the DIY fuel bomb and legged it. Several dramatic shots of explosions behind them later, they dropped down into the corridor in time to see a SansheCorp guard securing some sort of handcuffs to Shadow and Iktoc’s unconscious bodies. The lone guard was easily overpowered by Diamond’s newly-acquired thermal weapons, and Tak rushed to stabilize Shadow - a task in which he succeeded. Stabilizing Iktoc was less successful, unfortunately, and after several failed rolls his body continued to lay there, lifeless. The crew huddled around in the passageway, deliberating over the plight of their late comrade, before stuffing his body back up in the vent and pressing on with their mission.</p>

<p>Having loosely secured the door at one end of the corridor, they turned back to the cargo warehouse they had come from to hear a couple of voices over the still-blaring sirens - it seemed someone was investigating the body of the guard they had left in the shipping container when they arrived. Around this time Shadow started contacting Viktor, the hacker currently aboard Blue’s ship, about starting to get the AI on the ship (“The Carpenter”) into the prison’s systems. As Shadow tried to connect his dataslab to the terminal by the door, Diamond went all guns blazing into the shipping container to see two unarmoured (but not unarmed) members of facility staff investigating the dead body and damaged packaging. Although he missed several shots, shooting with a combat rifle he had recently obtained from Iktoc, Diamond was able to neutralize the two goons in the container. As Viktor started work on cracking the systems remotely, Tak, Diamond and Shadow decide to check the other containers for medical supplies, as Tak had run out and Diamond kept shouting “I need healing!”. They used a couple of shots from the thermal pistols at short range to heat the locks on the boxes and then smashed their way in - in the second container they checked, they found a couple of packets of small quick-heal patches (basically a much shitter Lift), which they applied as necessary, making sure to sneak about and avoid the attention of whoever was making the commotion at the end of the warehouses (the site of a recent bombing).</p>

<p>After this, the party went back into their little tunnel, deciding that with people back on their feet (or claws) and relatively safe, now would be a good time to rush as many guards as possible and find a place to wait while The Carpenter got into the system. Lurking behind the door, Tak detected about 10 people in the large central hall. Throwing Iktoc’s corpse out of the door as a makeshift barricade (with Diamond making an excellent dash back into cover), the crew opened fire from down the corridor at anyone who approached, taking out about five people like this. Eventually, however, the guards stopped shooting, but the party quickly found some more mooks were heading their way from behind them, in the warehouses. Shadow and Diamond handled them in an action-packed combat sequence of Shadow failing repeatedly to punch a dude, while Tak shot down the ceiling in the corridor, securing a proper barricade. During this scene Viktor messaged Shadow, telling him he couldn’t access much through the terminal in the door - he’d need to be connected to a proper computer.</p>

<p>Retreating back into the passageway and dismantling Tak’s defences, the crew quickly took out a guard who had dropped out from the vent in the corridor and, knowing more guards would be after them, used the rubble and metal from the barricade to smash through the thin polycrete corridor wall into a room they knew to be next door. After considerable time they broke through to an office, with a large touchscreen desk-terminal, several filing cabinets and posters about “Synergizing Outputs” and “Maximizing Efficiency”. Blocking up the tunnel they’d made, and the office’s door, Shadow plugged the dataslab into the desk and told Viktor to do his thing. This took some time, however, during which the guards had managed to acquire a sort of pneumatic battering ram, an impressively phallic machine they were using to smash through the blocked up tunnel. Unfortunately their efforts were futile as the two guards operating the battering ram were quickly mowed down by Diamond and Shadow as they crawled into the room. Grabbing the machine and re-blocking the entrance the crew hung about a bit longer, until finally Viktor notified Shadow to say that he seemed to be through, but the Carpenter didn’t seem to be doing anything. Nova attempted to contact the AI aboard the ship, to no avail, but back in the prison facility the lights shut off and the sirens ceased, leaving the place eerily quiet, save for the occasional shout of a guard or member of staff.</p>

<p>Impatient, the crew rammed their way through to the next office, blocking the tunnel as they went, finding two prison staff cowering under the desk. In the most peaceful action in the entire session, Shadow didn’t shoot them on sight but instead demanded they told him where the cells were - they did - and which cells housed Blue and Keltran. One of the clerks - an Aandrisk woman - went to go for her dataslab, to access the prison database, only to find it couldn’t connect to the prison network, which currently seemed to be down. The crew pushed forwards, deciding time was of the essence, and made a mad dash across the central hall to the corridor which lead to the cells. Although Shadow was true to his name and got across the hall in silence, Tak and Diamond got caught in the flashlights of a patrol of guards, barely managing to hold them off for long enough of get into the corridor. When they eventually did, they found a junction - this was not in the Aandrisk’s directions - and hurriedly took a left, finding themselves in a large room filled with rows of lockers. Just as they had made their way into the room, three guards burst through the door and opened fire. This fight was close, as Diamond was taken out midway through, but Shadow successfully dealt with the guards and Tak stabilized Diamond <em>just</em> in time.</p>

<p>Now safe behind yet another barricade, though admittedly badly injured, the crew began looking through the lockers, again heating the metal with a thermal pistol and then smashing in. They found mostly clothes and simple possessions - things that belonged to prisoners before they were processed and taken to their cells - but a few lockers had drugs, alcohol and basic medicines. The session ended with the PCs repeatedly checking these lockers - there were hundreds of them - which was a <em>very</em> exciting scene, let me tell you. Edge-of-your-seat tension. Great stuff.</p>
