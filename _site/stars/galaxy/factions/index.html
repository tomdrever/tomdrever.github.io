    <h1>Factions</h1>

<p class="strapline">A list of important factions in Valhallan Rho, the sector the PCs are playing in.</p>
<p class="strapline">Not an extensive list - there may be other factions the PCs haven't met yet</p>


<p><b>The Steppe Union</b> - A scavenger / pirate / smuggler group. The PCs had a brief spat with them in Malenhavn Central Port, after they arrived in the sector at the start of the game.</p>

<p><b>The Order of Valhalla</b> - A mysterious organisation of which Grigori, the human who was (and then wasn't) purchasing Tak's cargo, was a member.</p>

<p><b>Astrov Conglomerate</b> - A spacetech construction company. Is beginning work on a dyson sphere, conscripted by the Federation.</p>

<p><b>Church of the Gilded Gods</b> - New popular religious movement in the sector originating from Thorgunnav, in Rati, centered around 12 statuettes made from a strange material dug out from the planet's crust. The high-ranking friars of the Church claim this strange material - so-called "Aurum-Ichor" - talks to them. The Church is rather vague in terms of it's actual doctrines, spouting the usual messages of peace, harmony and compliance. It has a very hierarchical structure.</p>

<p><b>The Akordan Sovereignty</b> - A monarchy descended from some of the original Cudoxet colonies. A sort of vassal of the Federation.</p>

<p><b>Xetralone Corporation</b> - Also from some of the original Cudoxet colonies; a massive corporation that owns a couple of systems. On uneasy terms with the Federation, but makes business selling vital pharmaceuticals and biological components.</p>

<p><b>Madhav Scientific Council</b> - Scientific group. Operates the university-planet of Sperev, in Katla.</p>
