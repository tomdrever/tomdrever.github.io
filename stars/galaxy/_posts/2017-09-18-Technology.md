There are two types of technology present in the Stars Without Number galaxy - pretech and postech. Postech refers to current-era technology: stuff like energy weapons, Virtual Intelligences, space vessels and "jumping" (either between sectors, via a Wormhole Gate, or between systems, with a spike drive enabled ship). Pretech, on the other hand, is significantly advanced technology, in some cases indistinguishable from magic, constructed by precursor civilisations/organisations. This included stuff like teleportation, Artificial Intelligences, powerful weaponry and intricate control of powerful nanomachines.

(In the default system lore, the names pre- and pos- tech make more sense)

How technologically advanced a planet or station is is shown by its "Tech Level", ranging from 0 to 5, where 0 is stone age and five is pretech. Some planets are still TL3 - which is basically slightly ahead of where Humans are IRL (space vessels, decent communications tech, basic extraterrestrial colonies), but most are TL4 - postech. Places considered TL5 do exist, but are usually hard to find/get to, abandoned or otherwise unusable.
