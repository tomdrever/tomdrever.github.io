"Dust" is the name given to a strain of pretech nanomachines. Full control over Dust requires complex pretech - this leads to some planets being ravaged by "dust swarms" - though partial control has been achieved with postech, and simple pretech tools and weapons that use Dust are easy to operate. Dust is created by pretech fabricators found throughout the galaxy, leading many to believe its use was commonplace at some point in galactic history.
